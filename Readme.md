This repository is to track learning and development for Hibernate

<h2>Notes</h2>

1. <strong>How the concept came into picture?</strong> <br>
    We had Objects in OOP languages and relation/table in RDBMS. <br>
    The tables were analogous to classes while rows were analogous to objects. <br>
    The columns were analogous to fields while the column values were analogous to field values. <br>
    This showed that there can be a mapping between objects and relations. <br>
    This brought in the concept of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). <br><br>
2. <strong>What is Hibernate?</strong> <br>
    ORM is an idea where-as Hibernate is one such implementation of this idea i.e. it is an ORM implementation. <br>
